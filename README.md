## Quick Start

1. You need to have the Xero API image running and port forwarded to 3000.
   - The Node server will check `http://localhost:3000` to fetch data.
1. Ensure port `4000` is free as the backend / frontend will use that to communicate.
1. Next run these commands in the root of this repo.

```
npm i
npm run install-deps
npm start
```
